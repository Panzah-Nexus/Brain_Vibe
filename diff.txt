 [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a language for application-scale JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional types to JavaScript that support tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for any browser, for any host, on any OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript. Try it out at the [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/), and stay up to date via [our blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/typescript).
