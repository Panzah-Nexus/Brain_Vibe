# Template for the prompt to Gemini
GEMINI_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert programming topic analyzer. Analyze the provided code diff to identify new programming concepts, technologies, libraries, patterns, or methodologies that would be valuable for a programmer to learn.

CODE DIFF:
{code_diff}

USER'S ALREADY COMPLETED TOPICS:
{completed_topics}

USER'S ALREADY IDENTIFIED TO-LEARN TOPICS:
{to_learn_topics}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify programming concepts, technologies, or patterns evident in the code diff that represent discrete learning topics.
2. EXCLUDE any topics that appear in the COMPLETED or TO-LEARN lists above.
3. Merge any synonyms or near-duplicates (e.g., "React Hooks Basics" and "Using React Hooks" should be unified).
4. For each new topic, identify any direct prerequisites that should be learned first.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Respond with a list of new topics only. For each topic:
- Title: Concise, specific name for the topic (e.g., "React Context API" not just "React")
- Description: 1-2 sentence explanation of what this topic involves
- Prerequisites: List any prerequisite topics that should be learned first (if any)
- Code_References: Brief mention of where/how this appears in the diff

No introduction or conclusion text is needed. Only analyze actual codeâ€”ignore comments, documentation, or configuration changes unless they introduce new programming concepts.
